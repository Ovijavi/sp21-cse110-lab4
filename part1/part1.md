## Part 1a

Var declaration
1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. returns error because result is out of scope
5. returns error because you cant change const variable
6. returns error because you cant change const variable

## Part1b

1. prints 3 because variable i is declared with var so it is seen in all scopes. At the end of the loop i will be value 3 because prices is 3 values long
2. prints 150 because discountedPrice is declared with var so it is seen in all scopes. At the end of the loop discountedPrice will be the price of the last value in prices array with applied discount.
3. prints 150 because finalPrice rounds the discounted price. Since the last value of discounted price was 150, finalPrice will round to 150 in the end of the loop.
4. array of new discounted prices
5. returns error because i is out of scope
6. returns error because discountedPrice is out of scope
7. prints 150 because finalPrice was declared outside of the loop. Since the finalPrice is the last discounted value in prices array then it has the value 150.
8. array of new discounted prices
9. returns i because i is out of scope
10. returns 3 because that is the length of the inputed array
11. array of new discounted prices

12. A. student.name
    B. student['Grad Year']
    C. student.greeting();

    H. NaN

14. A. true
    B. false
    C. true
    D. false
    E. false
    F. true

15. == compares two variables and ignores their data types
    === compares two variables and checks their data types

17. doubles the values of the inputed array. the callback fundtion doubles the inputed value and modifyArray loops through the array and callsback on each individual value.
